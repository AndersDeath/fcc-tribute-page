            <h2>1950s</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Belmondo's acting career properly began in 1953,
                    with two performances at the Théâtre de l'Atelier in
                    Paris in Jean Anouilh's Médée and Georges Neveux's
                    Zamore. Belmondo began touring the provinces with
                    friends including Annie Girardot and Guy Bedos.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Belmondo had a small role in the comedy Be Beautiful
                    But Shut Up (1958), appearing with Alain Delon,
                    followed by a role as a gangster in Young Sinners
                    (1958), directed by Marcel Carné.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Belmondo's first lead role was in Les Copains du
                    dimanche (1958).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>1960s</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Belmondo starred in Consider All Risks (1960), a
                    gangster story with Lino Ventura. He then played the
                    lead role in Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless (À bout de
                    souffle, 1960), which made him a major figure in the
                    French New Wave.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He followed it with Trapped by Fear (1960), then the Italian film
                    Letters By a Novice (1960). With Jeanne Moreau and director Peter Brook
                    he made Seven Days... Seven Nights (1961) which he later called "very
                    boring".
                </li>
                <li>
                    François Truffaut wanted Belmondo to play the lead in an adaptation of
                    Fahrenheit 451. This did not happen (the film was made several years
                    later with Oskar Werner); instead Belmondo made two movies with
                    Jean-Pierre Melville: the film noir crime film The Fingerman (Le Doulos,
                    1963) and Magnet of Doom (1963). He co-starred with Gina Lollobrigida in
                    Mad Sea (1963) and appeared in another comedy anthology, Sweet and Sour
                    (1963). There was some controversy when he was arrested for insulting a
                    policeman, when the policeman was charged with assaulting Belmondo.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>1970s</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Married Couple of the Year Two (1971) was also popular; even more so
                    was The Burglars (1971).
                </li>
                <li>
                    La scoumoune (1972) was a new version of A Man Named Rocca (1961). The
                    Inheritor (1973) was an action film as was Le Magnifique (1974).

                </li>
                <li>
                    He produced as well as starred in Stavisky (1974). Then he made a series
                    of purely commercial films: Incorrigible (1974); Fear Over the City
                    (1975) - one of Belmondo's biggest hits of the decade and the first time
                    he played a policeman on screen; Hunter Will Get You (1976); Body of My
                    Enemy (1977). Animal (1977) cast him as a stuntman opposite Raquel
                    Welch. He was a policeman in Cop or Hood (1979).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>1980s</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In 1980, Belmondo starred in another comedy, Le Guignolo. He was secret
                    service agent in The Professional (1981) and a pilot in Ace of Aces
                    (1982). These films were all very popular at the French box office but
                    damaged Belmondo's critical reputation.


                </li>
                <li>Belmondo kept to commercial films: Le Marginal (1983), a cop thriller;
                    Les Morfalous (1984), a World War Two French Foreign legion story; Happy
                    Easter, a comedy; Hold-Up (1985), a comic heist story (remade in
                    Hollywood as Quick Change); and Le Solitaire (1988), playing another
                    policeman. The last of these was a notable box office disappointment.
                </li>
                <li>In 1987, he returned to the theatre after a 26-year absence in a
                    production of Kean, adapted by Jean-Paul Sartre from the novel by
                    Alexandre Dumas.[citation needed] "I did theater for ten years before
                    going into movies and every year I planned to go back," he recalled. "I
                    returned before I became an old man." Kean was a hit, running for a
                    year.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>1990s and later career</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1990, he played the title role in Cyrano de Bergerac on the stage in Paris, another highly
                    successful production. He had a small role in One Hundred and One Nights (1995) then the lead in
                    Lelouch's version of Les Misérables (1995). Désiré (1996) was a comedy; Une chance sur deux
                    (1998) reunited him with Alain Delon; Peut-être (1999) was a science fiction comedy.
